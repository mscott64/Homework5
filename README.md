# Homework5


 For this assignment, you'll be implementing methods as though they are interview
 questions meaning there's no starter code and no test cases.
 You get a problem description and one or two clarifying examples.
 You must use good style and naming standards.
 Feel free to ask me more clarifying questions if needed.
 
 Implement your methods under their problem description.
